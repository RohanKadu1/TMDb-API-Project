# TMDb-API-Project
The project aims to utilize the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to gather information about TV shows, movies, and various aspects of the entertainment sector. By leveraging the capabilities of the TMDb API, the project can provide recommendations to users based on their preferences, including specific genres, favorite actors, and personal likes and dislikes. Additionally, the project can retrieve details about upcoming TV shows and movies, as well as identify the most popular and exclusive/new content available at any given time. 

To participate in the project and access the TMDb API, you will need to join TMDb and generate a developer API key. This API key will enable you to make requests and retrieve data from the TMDb database. The TMDb documentation link provided will offer guidance on how to use the API effectively.

Overall, the project aims to enhance the TV and movie-watching experience by leveraging the vast amount of information available through the TMDb API and providing personalized recommendations and up-to-date content details.
